Odd Facts is committed to protecting your privacy. We pledge to use information collected from this site responsibly. We will not sell, share, or rent this information, for commercial purposes, to any person or organization outside our company and its support affiliates.

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted through this website, its associated mobile applications, and sub-domains. This site and associated mobile apps and sub-domains may contain links to other Web sites operated by third parties. Odd Facts is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of these sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each site you visit.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can e-mail support at dabblelab.com.

## Information Collection and Use
Our Website does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor. We do recognize and collect IP address, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, domain name, and country/state. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitors’ movement, and analyze broad demographic information.

In order to offer and provide a customized, personal experience, this site uses cookies to store and help track your information. For example, we use cookies to help remind us who you are and to deliver content and services based on your account information. Cookies are simply pieces of information that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. The use of cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You will not be able to use this site and/or associated mobile apps if you set your browser to not accept cookies.

In some areas of our site, we ask you to provide personally identifiable information. The personal information you provide will be kept confidential and used only to support your interactions with our company.

## Registration
To access some content and/or services, we may require visitors to register. During registration, a visitor is required to provide personal contact information. This information is used to notify the visitor about the services on our site for which they have registered. It is optional for the visitor to provide some information, but is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience.

## Newsletters and Special Promotions
If a visitor wishes to subscribe to our newsletters or special promotions, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. We will not sell, share, or rent this information, for commercial purposes, to any third party person or organization who is not directly supporting the operations of our company.

## Information Requests
Questions and requests for information about our company, products, and services will be retained for follow up with individuals in addressing their specific inquiries. We may also contact you by mail or telephone regarding information on new products and services related to that request.

Circumstances may arise where our company is legally required to disclose personal information to third parties such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution, or governmental investigations.

## Choice/Opt-out
Odd Facts will send you information about our various products and services. Visitors and customers who no longer wish to receive e-mail promotions or newsletters may opt-out of receiving these communications by completing an opt-out form that will be referenced in every communication.

## Notification of Changes
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post and highlight the policy changes in our privacy policy this website.

## Security
Personal information is handled with the same quality of care as all other company information to ensure the integrity and security of your data. Odd Facts develops a variety of products and services for use by commercial customers. When you sign on to selected services, your password and user ID are automatically encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software so that they cannot be understood by a third party. When we ask users to provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of your Web browser becomes locked. You can also identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:).
